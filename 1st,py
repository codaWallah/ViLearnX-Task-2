# <!--                   Vulnerability Scanning Tool Development
# Objective
#          Create a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations.

# Skills Required
#     Cybersecurity
#     Network Security
#     Software Development
# Tools & Technologies
#         Python: General-purpose programming language for scripting the tool.
#         Nmap: Network scanner for discovering hosts and services on a computer network.
#         OpenVAS: Open-source vulnerability scanner and management solution.
#         Nessus: Vulnerability scanner for identifying and fixing vulnerabilities.
# Requirements & Implementation -->
# <!-- 1. Open Ports Scanning
# Use Nmap to scan for open ports on a network or website.

# Python Code for Open Ports Scanning: -->

import nmap

def scan_open_ports(target):
    nm = nmap.PortScanner()
    nm.scan(target, '1-65535')
    open_ports = [(host, port, nm[host]['tcp'][port]['state']) for host in nm.all_hosts() for port in nm[host]['tcp']]
    return open_ports


# <!-- 2. Outdated Software Detection
# Use OpenVAS to detect outdated software versions.

# Python Code for Outdated Software Detection: -->

        return report
    except VulnscanException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# <!-- 3. Configuration Checks
# Identify common misconfigurations that could lead to security risks.

# Python Code for Configuration Checks: -->

            if "misconfiguration_keyword" in line:
                misconfigurations.append(line.strip())

# Generate a report summarizing the findings and suggesting remediation steps.

# Python Code for Generating Reports: -->

    Open Ports:
    -----------
    {open_ports}
    
    Outdated Software:
    ------------------
    {outdated_software}
    
    Misconfigurations:
    ------------------
    {misconfigurations}
    
    Remediation Steps:
    ------------------
    1. Close unnecessary open ports.
    2. Update outdated software to the latest versions.
    3. Fix identified misconfigurations.
